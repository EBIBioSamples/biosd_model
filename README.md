  __ The BioSD Object Model __ 

This is the object model to be used for managing data in the EBI Bio-Sample Database Project (BioSD). This is an 
extension of the core-model project (TODO: link) 

  __ TODO __ 

* JUnit tests to be written and run
* DAOs (here and in the core model)
* Complete ORM annotations (database indexes, both here and in the core model)
* Use JAXB to map the model to XML (needed for things like web services, both here and in the core model)
