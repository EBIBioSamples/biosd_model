  __ The BioSD Object Model __ 

This is the object model to be used for managing data in the EBI Bio-Sample Database Project (BioSD). This is an 
extension of the [core-model project](https://github.com/EBIBioSamples/core_model).

You find documentation about the BioSD/Core models [here](/EBIBioSamples/biosd_model/blob/master/doc/core_and_biosd_object_model.zargo).

  __ TODO __ 

* (More) JUnit tests to be written and run
* Use JAXB to map the model to XML (needed for things like web services, both here and in the core model)
